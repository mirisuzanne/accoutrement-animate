/// # Third-Party Functions
/// We provide a standard set of
/// [math functions](./math.html)
/// for manipulating [time values](./times.html),
/// but you can also use third-party (or Sass-native) functions.
/// Because Sass 3.5+ requires first-class functions,
/// we provide a single place to store & manage functions
/// that you would like to use with Accoutrement Animate.
/// @group functions


// Functions
// ---------
/// Define any additional functions required
/// to generate relataionships in timing.
/// This is only necessary for newer versions of Sass,
/// where functions are first-class,
/// and can be captured using `get-function($name)`.
///
/// ```scss
/// $functions: (
///   'times': get-function('times'),
///   'divide': get-function('divide'),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// @group functions
/// @type map
/// @see $_LOCAL-ANIMATE-FUNCTIONS
$functions: () !default;


// Local Functions
// ---------------
/// These functions are defined internally,
/// and can be called by name without first being captured
/// using the Sass `get-function()` approach.
///
/// Don't make changes to this map directly.
/// You can add your own named functions in the `$functions` map.
///
/// @access public
/// @group functions
/// @see $functions
///
/// @type map
